REMOTE DEVICE SETUP - MODEL SELECTION GUIDE
==========================================

The remote device setup in quick_start.bat works as follows:

SCENARIO 1: User chooses "n" (No testing)
- Shows available models on server
- Displays connection instructions 
- Shows summary and returns to main menu
- NO model selection prompt (this is correct behavior)

SCENARIO 2: User chooses "y" (Yes, test connection)
- Shows available models on server
- Displays connection instructions
- Asks: "Run connect_to_ollama.bat now for testing? (y/n): y"
- THEN shows model selection:
  ðŸ¤– Available models for remote connection test:
  1. qwen2.5:0.5b
  2. tinyllama:latest
  3. qwen2.5-coder:7b
  4. llama3.2:latest
  
  ðŸ’¡ Choose a model to test the remote connection with:
  Choose model number for remote test (1-4): [USER SELECTS]

- Runs connect_to_ollama.bat with the selected model context

IMPORTANT: 
- Model selection ONLY appears when testing (y)
- When user chooses "n", it skips testing and goes to summary
- This is the intended behavior!

To see model selection:
1. Run quick_start.bat
2. Choose option 3 (Remote Device Setup)  
3. Choose "y" when asked about testing
4. You will then see the model selection menu
